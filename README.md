# VendingMachine 
 This is the first Capstone project from Java Bootcamp. We mainly used Java, Junit, Git for command line program. 
 
* Project Description:

  The vending machine consists of a main menu and a purchase menu. It can display all the stocked products with updated amount, generate receipts for customers and generate reports with transaction details to the owner. 
  
* Chanllenge we faced and deatures hope to implement in future: 
  
  There could be a better way to simplify the subtractFromCoinBank method.
  
* What I learned:

  a. A clean flow chart helps a lot during coding.  
 
  b. The Inventory map was first created with int key starting from 1,2,3,4 ... and so on, which was meaningless and not so useful. Then it got updated with key as product slot number and value as product information, which made the map very efficient.
  
* Credit to My teammate: 

  I worked on this project with teammate John Picillo. He was willing to spend time with me day and time to figure out issues and clear the logic together.
